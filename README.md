# Language Learning Chatbot using OpenRouter API

This project is an AI-powered chatbot that helps users learn a new language through real-time, scene-based conversations. It uses OpenRouter's LLM API for intelligent responses, detects grammar or vocabulary mistakes, logs them to a local database, and summarizes feedback to help users improve over time.

## üîç Features

- User onboarding: known language, target language, proficiency level
- Scene-based conversation context (e.g., restaurant, airport)
- Real-time chat using OpenRouter API
- Mistake detection and correction feedback
- Stores chats and mistakes in a local SQLite database
- Clean Gradio-based user interface

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenRouter API (Mistral 7B Instruct model)
- SQLite
- Gradio
- Requests library
